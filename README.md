# KOSSH
This is a simple Kindle SSH server extracted from koreader, and is encapsulated into a KUAL extension. To use it, you need a jailbroken Kindle with KUAL installed. Then you should extract the [package](https://github.com/guo-yong-zhi/KOSSH/releases) into Kindle's `extensions` directory.   
The extension has the following features:
* Start a SSH server without password
* Auto switch WiFi, if necessary
* Display the IP on Kindle's screen
* Prevent screen shutdown during connection
* Stop the running SSH server with the power key
